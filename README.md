# Machine Learning Project 1
- 10 years of Crime volume by crime type and area.
# 2 types of questions
1. Fundamental operations - query the data for summary statistics,
subsets, lists.
2. Problem Solving/ Investigation - Translate a business/social question
into a technical statement and solve.
# Question 1
- Join Population data with crime statistics table.
- Group by: Province and sum crimes over each year.
- What is the most dangerous province overall?
- Rank average crimes per year for all crime types.
# Question 2
- Contrast volume vs density of crimes.
- Compare population density and crime rate - do places with higher
population density tend to have higher crime rates (correlation)?
# Question 3
- Group by: Crime Type.
- In which provinces does drug-related crime occur more than 1000
times a year (on average).
- Which Province has the highest number of stations? What is the
average crime rate per station in this province?
# Question 4
- Correlations: What types of crimes would you expect to go hand in
hand? does the data confirm?
# Question 5:
- Plots/Visualizations: Boxplots and edf/Kernel density estimates of
some crime type distributions across time.
- Histogram of the distribution of some crime type across provinces.
- Create overlayed time series plots showing trend of all crime types
for Kwazulu/Natal.
- Create overlayed time series plots showing trend of total crime types
for all provinces.
# Question 6:
- Do any other exploration or analysis with the data apart from the
questions mentioned above.
